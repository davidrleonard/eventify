An event screen thingy
======

This is a simple event screen. It shows pretty text at an event.

# Use it on the web

1. Open up a new browser and point it [http://davidleonard.me/eventify/](http://davidleonard.me/eventify/)
2. Fill out the prompts
3. Put it on a giant monitor or TV at your event

**Pro-tip:** Too big? Too small? Zoom in or out with your browser.

# Use it on your computer

```
git clone [repo-link]
cd eventify
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open a browser window and point it at the url and port printed out by Python in your terminal. Do stuff with it.
